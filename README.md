# E-Commerce

For this project, I aim to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Iâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. My main motivation for this project is to provide the manager of the internet retail company a back end for their e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that their company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

# Installation
In order to use this app, you will need to install a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. In addition, you will need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect to the Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.
